#OverView of Project :

#Topic-CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION AND ANALYSIS

#Objective: 

The objective of this project is to analyze customer behavior in a mall setting by segmenting customers into distinct groups using KMeans clustering. This segmentation will help identify patterns and characteristics within each group, enabling targeted marketing strategies. By understanding the diverse needs of these customer segments, the mall can optimize its services and enhance customer satisfaction.

#KEY ACTIVITIES:- 
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the mall dataset by handling missing values, normalizing features, and selecting relevant variables that influence customer behavior, such as annual income and spending score.
2. KMeans Clustering: Applying the KMeans algorithm to segment customers into distinct clusters based on their shopping behavior, analyzing the optimal number of clusters using methods like the elbow method.
3. Cluster Analysis: Interpreting and profiling the identified customer segments, visualizing the clusters using plots, and deriving insights to inform marketing strategies, such as personalized promotions or targeted advertising campaigns.

#Libraries Used:- 

1. Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
2. NumPy: For numerical computations.
3. Scikit-learn: For implementing the KMeans clustering algorithm and other machine learning tasks.
4. Seaborn: For data visualization and plotting the clusters.
